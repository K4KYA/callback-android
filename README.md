# Callback for Android

## What?

Callback is an app which reacts to SMS triggers to callback someone automatically.

## Why?

A few scenarios where this might be useful:

 - You need to talk to someone who is near their phone but otherwise unable to answer
 - A simple baby monitor
 - To find your phone
 
## How?

Callback is written fully in [Kotlin 1.2](https://kotlinlang.org/) and includes Unit and UI tests for the main activity and presenter.
Callback currently supports Android API 21+ and targets API 27, with support for runtime permissions.
