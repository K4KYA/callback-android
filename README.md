# Callback for Android

##What?

Callback is an app which reacts to SMS triggers to callback someone automatically.

##Why?

A few scenarios where this might be useful:

 - You need to talk to someone who is near their phone but otherwise unable to answer
 - A simple baby monitor
 - To find your phone
 
##How?

Callback is written fully in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and I intend for it to remain that way.
